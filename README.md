# Quantum Autoencoder for Quantum Data Compression

## Introduction
 Quantum computing have been showing its tremendous advantages in many tasks, where it is slow or even impossible for classical algorithms to be employed, ranging from cryptography to quantum simulation. For example, once we have sufficiently powerful quantum computers, Shor's algorithm will factorize large numbers in minutes. Quantum simulators for chemistry have also been shown to be capable of efficiently calculating molecular energies for small system. In our NISQ area, however, the limited amount of quantum computing resources may prevent us from achieving desired results. Therefore, it is essential to find methods to compress quantum data, saving up resources needed. Our Quantum Autoencoder (QAE) project is based on the model proposed by Romero et al. \cite{}. We implement a quantum-classical hybrid procedure to perform training QAE, then we demonstrate its performance on MNIST handwritten digits database.
